# <Coding-Quiz>
## Description
In this project we had to create a small quiz based on anything using javascript, for the most part. In this project, I learned a lot on how to use java to make new elements in the HTML file and how to use them properly. Additionally, this quiz can also keep track of the users score and save it into a local database for a highsscore leaderboard. The project was based on the following criteria:
## Table of Contents

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
